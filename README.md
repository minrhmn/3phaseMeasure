# Three-Phase AC Power and Voltage Measurement in Arduino

In the "Three-Phase AC Power and Voltage Measurement in Arduino" project, I embarked on a mission to create a user-friendly and cost-effective solution for monitoring electrical systems. Utilizing Arduino's versatile platform, I developed a system capable of accurately measuring power and voltage in a three-phase AC configuration.

This project aimed to simplify the complex task of monitoring electrical consumption in industrial and residential settings, calculating complex power. By connecting Arduino to the AC system, I harnessed its computational power to calculate and display real-time power consumption and voltage fluctuations.
